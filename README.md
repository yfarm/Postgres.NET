# Postgres.NET
Postgres.NET is a simple .NET database wrapper for PostgreSQL. It is an efficient replacement for those who don't want to use an ORM framework, like
Entity Framework or NHibernate. While ORM frameworks are nice and easy to use at times, they also come with come with several drawbacks, especially
when trying to build complex and high performace applications. PostgreSQL is an amazing database and it is fairy easy for an experienced developer 
to put his business logic in database functions and call it throw a thin wrapper, which is way more efficient and faster than using an ORM. The goal
of this project is to provide a simple database wrapper to work with PostgreSQL. It can also be easily modified to work with other databases, such
as MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. Its only dependency is Npsql. You can read more about it at http://www.npgsql.org.
