# Postgres.NET
Postgres.NET is a simple .NET database wrapper for PostgreSQL. It is an efficient replacement for those who do not want to use an ORM framework, like
Entity Framework or NHibernate. While ORM frameworks are nice and easy to use at times, they also come with come with several drawbacks, especially
when trying to build complex and high performace applications. PostgreSQL is an amazing database and it is fairy easy to use for an experienced developer 
who wants to put his business logic in database functions and call them through a thin wrapper, which is way more efficient and faster than using an ORM. 
The goal of this project is to provide a simple database wrapper to work with PostgreSQL. It can also be easily modified to work with any database that
has an ADO.NET data provider, such as MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc. The project on dependent on the Npsql data provider for PostgreSQL. 
You can read more about it at http://www.npgsql.org. Please download the sample project or get it through GIT and play around with the samples 
before importing the code into your own project. In the console project you will find a test.script that you need to run on a ProgreSQL database 
before running the samples. Also don't forget to updated the database credentials in the connection string. The samples are fairly salf-explanatory.
